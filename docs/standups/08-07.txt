Name: Ishaan Upadhyay

What have you done since yesterday?
    - Changed code to use Hashmaps instead of ArrayLists for storing events and participants

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Change code to use childEventListener for efficiency concerns (Do not want to fetch entire list of events for individual changes)
    - Use a SortedList<Event> in EventsAdapter instead of an ArrayList<Event> so that I can display events in order of start time
    - Add functionality to buttons in each recyclerView item using onClickListener

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
