Name: Ishaan Upadhyay

What have you done since yesterday?
    - Changed code to use Hashmaps instead of ArrayLists for storing events and participants

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Change code to use childEventListener for efficiency concerns (Do not want to fetch entire list of events for individual changes)
    - Use a SortedList<Event> in EventsAdapter instead of an ArrayList<Event> so that I can display events in order of start time
    - Add functionality to buttons in each recyclerView item using onClickListener

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- none

Name: Catherine Sun

What have you done since yesterday?
	- Wrote current customer to shared preferences
	- However, the emulator device file explorer cannot be accessed until the file is written to. This shouldn't affect the app I think

What are you planning on doing today?
	- nil

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Can't open many folders in the emulator's device file explorer until the first customer signs in
