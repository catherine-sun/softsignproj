What have you done since yesterday?
	- updated EventsAdapter and recyclerView so that they would correctly fetch from the database
    - Drew the view for the first time

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Replace ArrayList<String> signedUp in (data/model/Event.java) with Hashmap<String, String> and ArrayList<Event> in EventsPage 
    with Hashmap<String, Event> so I can fetch items pushed using DatabaseReference.push() 

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Each recyclerView item isn't filling the width of the screen
    - Using ArrayList to store events fetched from database poses problems for removing events
