What have you done since yesterday?
    - Modified EventsPage and EventsAdapter to use Hashmaps for storing events and participants instead of ArrayLists
    - Made recyclerView items fill entire screen width

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Start working on switching from onDataChanged event listener to child event listener due to working with a list of events

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- none
