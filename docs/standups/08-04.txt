Name: Ishaan Upadhyay

What have you done since yesterday?
	- figured out the cause of errors relating to fetching from the database 
	(Firebase was returning values in wrapper types for primitives, i.e. java.lang.Long)
	- Helped Daniel to fix code relating to fetching from database
	(adapter was getting dereferenced because it was recreated in onDataChanged, so initially fetched list of events wasn't being drawn)

What are you planning on doing today?
	- update my own code with the EventsAdapter and recyclerView to fix the errors that arose in Daniel's work
	- work on properly fetching items from the database, because I need the list of signed up users as well

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- none
